I understand, am taking too long to complete a task & hence can we have monthly goals as how much we can reach by end of a month ?
Learning Method: i generally goggle for topics & exmaples and use them as per our task need. is this the correct way of doing ? what other way of learnings can you please recommend ?
I would like to get good in Javascript coding also.. can i aim for hackerrank problems one at a day ? or do you suggest any other way?
As based on our so far learning, i am not much confident to explain the same to some one else. How do i improve?
Can you please let me know my mistakes & improvements so far ?
